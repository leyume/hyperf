# Hyperf on Docker with a Watcher

This is the <a href="https://hyperf.wiki/" target="_blank">Hyperf Framework</a> on docker with a watcher that reloads whenever file changes are made so you don't have to restart your server. You need to have Docker and Docker-Compose installed. 

<hr />

### To run

$ <code>
docker compose build && docker compose up
</code>

OR

$ <code>
docker-compose build && docker-compose up
</code>
<br /><br />

You can use the flag ```-d``` to run as daemon (in the background)
